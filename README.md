# FYP-Django

This is a Final Year Project

It's not RUNABLE because it Not contains the BIG files such as the running result, the models the checkpoint, and the pretrained BERT model

For sentence NER, it's similar as http://opennre.thunlp.ai/#/sent_re

It can also Recognize the Named Entity and predict the Relations

If you want all the RUNABLE files, feel free to contact me.
